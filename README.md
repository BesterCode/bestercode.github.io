## Credits
The first half of Sega titles is a connoisseur list composed by [Nutmeg](https://rpgcodex.net/forums/members/nutmeg.16903/)\
The second half consists of mass audience oriented games by the author of this repo.\
The same goes for NES titles.\
To contribute, simply add something to [sega.yaml](https://github.com/BesterCode/bestercode.github.io/blob/master/src/assets/sega.yaml) or [nes.yaml](https://github.com/BesterCode/bestercode.github.io/blob/master/src/assets/nes.yaml) following yaml's indentation rules.\
Text (e.g. game title or description) that contains the `:` character must be enclosed into parantheses.
